Reflux

Boil (so heated to boiling point) liquid, then condense 
Seems to use 30 minute timer??

Increasing teos increases viscosity
Water dont play with, increase ratio with teos
Ethanol can be changed
Phosphoric acid mostly changes viscosity

General procedure to make chemical
Mix chemicals (listed in file sod.md) for specific formula 
Ie - N type, P type basic, etc.
Mix in round bottomed flask
Reflux for 30ish minutes with stir bar, at boiling (so 1-200 C) maybe test just teos + water + ethanol to find ideal viscosity time then continue with that
If using immediately, use. Otherwise put on ice / store in as cold as possible

Spin coating
Apply a few drops, enough to cover precut silicon wafer (more specifications in mosfet.md on type of water)
Spin at 3500-4000 rpm, enough for thin layer to form
Heat at 120-220C temperature for 15ish minutes on preheated hot plate (realistically until solid and smooth)

Tube furnace
Should be done immediately after spin coating
Put in tube furnace at X temperature for Y time (tested variables)
Tube furnace heat up to temp and cool down (as to not damage wafer from thermal shock)
Do under nitrogen gas in tube furnace 
Found from standard semiconductor graph or made from proprietary chemicals
Take out and leave to cool

Pre-test prep
HF etch  
2%

Test
4 point probe (more details needed)

Junction depth with SEM or similar

What is the dopant concentration (and potentially diffusion depth) for TEOS based N and P type dopant formulas at different predeposition times and temperatures?
Likely a few optimal concentrations and/or diffusion depths

Controls:
Prebought silicon for concentration/sheet resistivity
Proprietary for diffusion depth (although this is more for my curiosity than actually relevant)
No process
