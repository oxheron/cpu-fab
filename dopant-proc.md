Reflux

Boil (so heated to boiling point) liquid, then condense 
Seems to use 30 minute timer??

Increasing teos increases viscosity
Water dont play with, increase ratio with teos
Ethanol can be changed
Phosphoric acid mostly changes viscosity

For phosphorus, 1100C for 1 hour gets 10^20 doping conc. 

General procedure to make chemical
Mix chemicals (listed in file sod.md) for specific formula 
Ie - N type, P type basic, etc.
Mix in round bottomed flask
Reflux for 30ish minutes with stir bar, at boiling (so 1-200 C) maybe test just teos + water + ethanol to find ideal viscosity time then continue with that
If using immediately, use. Otherwise put on ice / store in as cold as possible

Spin coating
Apply a few drops, enough to cover precut silicon wafer (more specifications in mosfet.md on type of water)
Spin at 3500-4000 rpm, enough for thin layer to form
Heat at 120-220C temperature for 15 time on preheated hot plate

Tube furnace
Should be done immediately after spin coating
Put in tube furnace at X temperature for Y time (tested variables)
Do under nitrogen gas in tube furnace (if possible)
If not, then regular air for consistency (do one for tests)
Found from standard semiconductor graph
Question? Why these times/why hypothesis
Take out and leave to cool

Pre-test prep
HF etch (probably) (more details needed) 

Test
4 point probe (more details needed)

What is the dopant diffusion for TEOS based N and P type dopant formulas at different times and temperatures?

Controls:
Propreitary Chemicals?
Their graphs?
