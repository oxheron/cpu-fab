General Process v0.1

Start: Wafer - p or n (doesnt really matter) - <100> - epi layer - no oxide - no poly
1. Deposit wells (p and n type) across wafer
2. Separate other doped parts with SiO2
3. Dope p & n source drain  
4. Grow gate oxide 
5. Coat gate metal
6. Coat in dialectric - probably photoresist
7. Create connections
If using copper electroplating then do 6 and 7 in steps so the plating can be done over the silver
If not, (hopefully not), this wont be needed
8. Passivation layer
9. Bond pad connections and copper e plating

Procedures needed
Oxidation
Cleaning
Etching 
Coating/Doping
