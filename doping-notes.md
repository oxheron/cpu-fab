Bandgap - fundamental

Semiconductor materials - silicon etc. somewhat conductive
Semiconductor devices - made from silicon, behaves based on transistors

Semiconductor materials - conductivity can change (conductor vs insulator)
Electrical input changes conductivity

How do semiconductors change conductivity? 

What is conductivity? 

Energy to move electron from point to another is fighting columb force
Gained as PE (columb potential)
When electron falls back to nucleus light/heat created
To gain heat/light is absorbed
Energy calculated by columb force

QM has different story
Also because amplitude squared, 2 wave functions have same amplitude
B/c of QM 2 (spin) electrons fill an orbital of specific energy level 
Certain amount of energy needed to move

Conductivity (Pt. 2)
Ionization separates energy from atom
Additional energy moves electron very fast 
But this is unpractical

Metal atoms / solids have different properties b/c different atoms
Potential energy at center of 2 atom system is not 0
As atoms get closer energy levels are shared, and it can fall between either state
Eventually ground state is sharing electron
However Pauli electron principle moves electrons to higher orbitals b/c 2 orbitals go to 1, but this isn't what happens in reality
B/c of qm wave function amplitudes covalent bonds can form
Different behavior based on underlying wavefunctions, b/c 2 orbitals are formed (bonding and antibonding)
Bonding orbital also has lower energy, which makes covalent bonds stable

With many atoms, energy bands form b/c there are many, many, orbitals and heat contributes enough energy for electrons to move in continuum
For partially filled band, electrons can kinda just move around
Insulator has very high next band

Semicondutors have filled band, but next band is close
Temperature can change this because of fermi dirac distributions (b/c thermal energy)
Barrier of bands is removed by voltage (not explained)
As voltage goes up then barrier drops, and electrons can cross
