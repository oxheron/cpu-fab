TEOS & water forms SiO2
Forced to be mixed with ethanol
Fluorine catalyst (maybe not) needed b/c it will solidify to quickly
PH very relevant to shape and time as well (acidic so it forms mesh)
Use heat to speed reaction up, get it to spinnable phase quickly
Do reflux to heat to get to spinnable timeframe

Generally should be in range that is low speed so it has (some) shelf life

Basic N type recipe teos
1ml teos
1ml H20
4ml Ethanol
0.5-0.4ml Phosphoric acid 85% (variable)

Basic P type recipe teos 
1ml teos 
1ml H20
4ml Ethanol
0.5 ml Boric acid x% (0.7-0.3g tested, likely better range)

pH target P type teos, boric acid, (buffered)
1ml teos
1ml H20
4ml Ethanol
0.3-0.5g boric acid (variable)
0.5 ml 0.082 M sulfuric acid solution
Target ph 1.9

Maybe/probably not (b/c trimethyl borate will just form boric acid)
pH target P type teos, trimethyl borate, (buffered) 
1ml teos
1ml H20
4ml Ethanol
0.6-0.8g trimethyl borate (variable)
0.5ml 0.082 M sulfuric acid 
Target ph 1.9

Ideas - potentially try much less boric acid

Variables/Procedure after mixing
Time and temp of reflux (variables)

Then spin on, heat on hot plate to get rid of solvent, and put in furance
(time and temp variables, start with fastest each, but parameterize)

Etch in HF to remove glass
